This is a basic website for the ABC Learning Center which is an online skill development institute which has multiple courses for the student to choose from.

This website has very limited functionality as of now and new features will be updated in the newer versionss. 

The website has multiple features along with a registration form and also a user management page which can be accessed by adding "user.html" in the address bar in place
of the page name. 

On the User Management Page, the admins of the website can manage the users registered with them, i.e., they can delete, edit or add a new user. 
All the members along with their info will be added to automatically when they enter their details in the form. 

NOTE: 
# The "Register" button will apear only on the home page and not the other pages. 
# You might not be able to see the icons used for the social media on the website if you open it using the github link as the icons are used from a folder and not using
  a CDN link, if needed, you may insert the CDN link for the icons.
